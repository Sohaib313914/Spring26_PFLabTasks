1. Understand the Concept of Decision Structures:
o Grasp the importance of decision-making in programming and how it helps in controlling the flow of
a program.

2. Learn Basic Decision-Making Statements:
o Familiarize yourself with the primary decision structures in C, such as if, if-else, and switch statements.
3. Implement if and if-else Statements:
o Learn how to use if statements to execute code blocks based on a condition.
o Use if-else statements to handle multiple branches, allowing different actions based on whether a
condition is true or false.

4. Use switch Statements for Multiple Choices:

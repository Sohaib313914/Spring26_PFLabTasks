Objectives:
Efficiently Handle Multiple Scenarios:
• To allow the program to handle multiple scenarios or conditions effectively without requiring excessive
repetition of code.
Simplify Complex Condition Checking: 
• To break down complicated decisions into smaller, more manageable conditions, making the code easier to
understand and maintain.
Support Hierarchical Decision Logic:
• To support decisions that depend on previous outcomes, where a specific condition can only be evaluated if
another has already been satisfied or failed.
Optimize Code Readability and Maintenance:
• Structure code in a way that is easier to read and maintain, with clearly defined decision-making paths.
Minimize Redundancy:
• To reduce code duplication by nesting decisions, allowing for more efficient logic where common conditions
can be reused in different decision branches.
